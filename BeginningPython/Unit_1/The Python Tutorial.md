# The Python Tutorial
------

    Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and simple
    but effective approach to obejct-oriented programming. Python's elegant sytax and dynamic typing, together with its
    interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most
    platforms.

    The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form
    for all major platforms from the Python Web site.

    The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++

    The tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and
    system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hans-on experience, but all examples are

Python is just the language for you
> * You can write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks
> * Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer
> * Python allows you to split your program into modules than can be reused in other Python programs.
> * Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary.
> * Python enable programs to be written compactly and readably.
> * Python is extensible.
