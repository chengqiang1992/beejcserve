# AN Informal Introduction to Python
------
in the following example, inpput and output are distinguished by the presence or basence of prompts(>>> and ...), you
must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from
the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line but itsself in an example means your must type a blank line;
this is used to end a multi-line comand.

Many of the example in this manual, even those entered at the interpreter prompt, include comments. Comments in Python
start with the hash character,#, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment many appear at the start of a line
of following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A has character within a string literal is just a hash
character. Since comments are to clearify code and are not interpreter by Python, then may be omitted when typing in
examples.

let's try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and wait for the primary prompt, >>> (It shouldn't take long)
