Reading this tutorial has probably reinforced your interest in using Python - you should be eager to apply Python to
solving your real-world problems. Where should you go to learn more?

This tutorial is part of Python's documentation set. Some other documents in the set are:

    The Python Standard Library:
        You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (through terse) reference material about types,
        functions, adn the modules in the standard library. The standard Python distribution includes a lot of
        additional code. These are modules to read Unix mailboxes, retrieve documents bia HTTP, generate random numbers,
        parse command-line options, write CGI programs, compress data, and many other tasks. Skimming through the
        Library reference will give you an idea of  what's available.

    Installing Python Modules:
        explains how to install additional modules written by other Python users.
    The Python Language Reference:
        A detailed explanation of Python's syntax and semantics. It's heavy reading, but is useful as a complex as a
        complex guide to the language itself.
