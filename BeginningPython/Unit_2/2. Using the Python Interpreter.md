# 2. Using the Python Interpreter
------

## 2.1 Invoking the interpreter
if that doesn't work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: **quit()**

when invoking Python, you may specify any of rthese options:
**python [-bBdEhiIOqsSuvVWx？]  [-c commang | -m module | script | - ] [ ARGS]**
The monst common use case is, of course, a simple invocation of a script
**python myscript.py**

The interpreter interface resembles that of the unix shell, but provides some addtional methods of invocation:
> * When called with standard input connected to a tty device, it prompts for commands and executes them until an EOF(an end-of-file character, you can produce that with Ctrl-D on UNIX or Ctrl-Z, Enter on Windows) is read
> * When called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and excutes a script from that file.
> * When called with a directory name argument, it reads and exectutes an appropriately named script from that directory
> * When called with -c command, it executes the Python statement(s) given as commond. Here command many contain multiple statements separted by newlines. Leading whitespaces is significant in Python statements!
> * When called with -m module-name, the given module is located on the Python module path and executed as a script.
