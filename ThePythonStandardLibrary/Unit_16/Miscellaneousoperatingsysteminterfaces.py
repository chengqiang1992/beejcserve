16.1. os --- Miscellaneous operating system interfaces

    This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality. If you just want to read or
    write a file see open(), if you want to manipulate, see the os.path module, and if you want to read all the lines in
    all the files on the command line see the fileinput module. For creating temporary files and directories see the
    tempfile module, and for hight-level file and directory handling see the shutil module.
